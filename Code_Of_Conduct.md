# Issue Queue

To ensure smooth project management and make it easier for contributors to get started, we organize tasks using labels. These labels help you understand the type of issue at hand and the difficulty level.

### Available Labels:
- **`bug`**: For confirmed bugs that need to be fixed.
- **`enhancement`**: For improvements or new features to be added to the project.
- **`good first issue`**: Tasks that are beginner-friendly and ideal for newcomers who are looking to contribute.

Please make sure to use these labels when creating new issues to ensure clarity and ease of contribution.

# Comments for Clarity

Clear and well-structured code is essential for efficient collaboration. Here are some commenting guidelines for contributors:

### When to Comment:
- **Complex Logic**: If your code implements complex or unconventional logic, add comments explaining why a certain approach was taken or how it works.
- **Avoid Stating the Obvious**: Donâ€™t write comments that simply restate what the code is doing. Instead, explain *why* the code works in that particular way or *what problem it solves*.
- **Descriptive Variable Names**: Use meaningful and descriptive variable names. If the variable name clearly expresses its purpose, comments become less necessary.

### Example:
```javascript
// Good comment
// Checking if the user is authenticated to grant access to the dashboard
if (user.isAuthenticated) {
    // ...
}
```

# No Sensitive Information

To ensure the security and privacy of the project:
- **Never hard-code sensitive information** such as database credentials, API keys, or passwords in the code.
- Use environment variables (`.env` files) to store sensitive data.
- Add the `.env` file to the `.gitignore` file to prevent accidental exposure of sensitive information.

Example `.gitignore` entry:
```
.env
```

By following these guidelines, we can maintain a secure, professional, and respectful environment for all contributors. Letâ€™s work together to build a positive and collaborative community!

Thank you for contributing and respecting these guidelines! ðŸŒŸ
