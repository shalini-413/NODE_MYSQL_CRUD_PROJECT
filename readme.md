# Node.js MySQL CRUD API

## Project Description
This project is a **REST API** for managing **student records**. It allows users to perform **CRUD operations** (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on student data stored in a MySQL database. This API is built using **Node.js**, **Express**, and **MySQL** with the **mysql2/promise** library for seamless asynchronous database interactions.

## Installation Instructions

To get this project up and running on your local machine, follow these steps:

### 1. Clone the Repository
Clone the project to your local machine using Git:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/shalini-413/NODE_MYSQL_CRUD_PROJECT.git
cd NODE_MYSQL_CRUD_PROJECT
```

### 2. Install Dependencies
Run the following command to install the required dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Set Up MySQL Database
- Create a MySQL database named `students_db`.
- Configure your MySQL database connection in the `config/db.js` file.

```js
const db = mysql.createPool({
    host: 'localhost',
    user: 'root',
    password: 'your_password',
    database: 'students_db',
});
```

### 4. Start the Server
Start the application by running the following command:
```bash
node server.js
```

Your API will be live at `http://localhost:8000`.

## Tech Stack

- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 engine.
- **Express**: Web framework for building APIs.
- **MySQL**: Relational database management system.
- **mysql2/promise**: MySQL client for Node.js with Promise-based API for asynchronous database interactions.

## API Usage Examples

The following routes are available:

### 1. **GET** `/api/v1/student/getall`
Retrieve all student records from the database.
```bash
GET /api/v1/student/getall
```

### 2. **GET** `/api/v1/student/get/:id`
Retrieve a specific student by their ID.
```bash
GET /api/v1/student/get/:id
```

### 3. **POST** `/api/v1/student/create`
Create a new student record.
- Request body: `name`, `roll_no`, `fees`, `medium`
```bash
POST /api/v1/student/create
```

### 4. **PUT** `/api/v1/student/update/:id`
Update an existing studentâ€™s information by ID.
- Request body: `name`, `roll_no`, `fees`, `medium`
```bash
PUT /api/v1/student/update/:id
```

### 5. **DELETE** `/api/v1/student/delete/:id`
Delete a student record by ID.
```bash
DELETE /api/v1/student/delete/:id
```

## Main Features
